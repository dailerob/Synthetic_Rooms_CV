Basic info is covered by competition_Details.pdf

geometry_node_tests.blend is the blender file that generates room - it should be set up to go, just switch to rendered view or render an animation to start producing images.

python_code contains two generator files: 
   room_builder: which generates random room layouts used by blender to arrange rooms
   class_estimator: which estimates which classes are in a scene based on metadata

For the github, 40 room layouts, generated images, and metadata are saved as examples. (metadata and gernated images are under pics)
